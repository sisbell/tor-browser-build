### Updating Gradle Dependencies
If additional android dependencies are added to the Firefox Android build, then
the gradle build will fail due to missing dependencies. To find out what the
missing dependencies are, comment out the following line in the firefox build
file:

   export GRADLE_MAVEN_REPOSITORIES="file://$rootdir/[% c('input_files_by_name/gradle-dependencies') %]"

and rerun the build.

Dependent artifacts will show up as downloads in the logs. You can pull out
these dependencies into a list with the following command:

`cat logs/firefox-android-armv7.log | grep "Download http" | sed "s/^.*Download //g" > download-urls.txt`

You will then need to add the new dependency URLs and sha256 values into the
projects/firefox/gradle-dependencies-list.txt file. The format of this file is
pipe delimited
   sha256sum | url

Finally, in the firefox config file increment the
var/gradle_dependencies_version and make sure to restore the firefox build file
back to original.

It may also be the case that you wish to cleanup old versions of the artifacts.
For this you will need to run the build with an empty
gradle-dependencies-list.txt file and proceed to reconstruct the list from
scratch.
