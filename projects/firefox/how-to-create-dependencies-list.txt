### Updating Gradle Dependencies
If additional android dependencies are added to the Firefox Android build, then they will show up as downloads in the logs. You can pull out these dependencies into a list with the following command:

`cat logs/firefox-android-armv7.log | grep "Download http" | sed "s/^.*Download //g" > download-urls.txt`

You will then need to add the new dependency URLs and sha256 values into the projects/firefox/gradle-dependencies-list.txt file. The format of this file is pipe delimited
  * sha256sum | url

Finally, in the firefox config file increment the var/gradle_dependencies_version

Note, that if any dependencies have changed in the firefox build.gradle files, it is important to check the firefox-android-armv7.log to see if any new downloads are occurring. This can be done by running the cat command above and observing that the download-urls.txt file is empty.

It may also be the case that you wish to cleanup old versions of the artifacts. For this you will need to run the build with an empty gradle-dependencies-list.txt file and proceed to reconstruct the list from scratch.
